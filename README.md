- The game is divided in two phases: the deployment phase and the play phase.

### Deploy Phase

- At the start of a standard game, a player may place any of their pieces in the any unoccupied square in the first 3 throws at their end of the board.
- The opposing player will then place a piece of the their choose in their first 3 rows in an unoccupied square.
- This continues back and forth until each player has played all of their 25 pieces.
- The player who placed the first piece makes the first move.

### Play Phase

- This phase of the game is very similar to chess, with the moving and taking of pieces.
